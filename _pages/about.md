> Always Day1. Always humble.

I am Hengxu Lin, currently pursuing a master's degree in applied statistics at Fudan University (expected to graduate in 2023), supervised by Professor [Zhongyu Wei](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/). I am a member of [Fudan DISC](http://fudan-disc.com/), interested in natural language processing, especially dialogue system. Also, I am interested in recommendation system. I used to work as a recommendation system engineer at ByteDance, responsible for the push business of Toutiao. I've always been curious and passionate about things I find interesting. If you want to know more about me, please read my [resume](../files/resume-english.pdf)([简历](../files/resume-chinese.pdf)).
